.SH NAME
lnst-ctl \- Linux Network Stack Test controller
.SH SYNOPSIS
.BR
.B lnst-ctl
[\fIOPTION\fR]... \fIACTION\fR \fIRECIPE\fR...
.SH DESCRIPTION
Linux Network Stack Test is a tool that supports development and execution
of automated and portable network tests. For detailed description of the
architecture of LNST please refer to project website
(link listed on
.B INTERNET RESOURCES
bellow).

.B lnst-ctl
is a script used for managing slaves. It reads a recipe XML file as an
input and executes tests on the specified slave machines.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.BI "\-c, \-\-config" =file
Load a custom configuration file in addition to
.I /etc/lnst-ctl.conf
and
.I ~/lnst/lnst-ctl.conf
that are loaded by default.
.TP
.B \-d, \-\-debug
Toggle emitting debugging messages.
.TP
.B \-h, \-\-help
Display usage of this command.
.TP
.B \-m, \-\-no\-colours
Disable coloured terminal output.
.TP
.B \-o, \-\-disable\-pool\-checks
Skip the pool machine availability checks.
.TP
.B \-p, \-\-packet\-capture
Capture and log all ongoing network communication between the slaves
during the test.
.TP
.BI "\-x, \-\-result" =file
Write results in XML format to the specified
.IR file .
.TP
.B "\-r, \-\-reduce-sync"
Disable synchronization of module and tool resources to slave machines,
when python tasks are used in the recipe. Instead the user can manually
synchronize resources from the python task itself. This option has no effect if
the recipe only contains xml tasks.
.PP
.I RECIPE
can be either a LNST recipe file or a directory containing recipe files.
One or more files/directories can be passed at the same time. Each recipe
is a XML file. The format is described in detail in the online documentation
available at LNST wiki (link is listed on
.B INTERNET RESOURCES
bellow).

.I ACTION
can be one of
.BR "run",
.BR "config_only",
.BR "deconfigure" ", and"
.BR "match_setup".

When it is set to
.BR "run",
all provided recipe files will be sequentially executed. The network will
be configured accordingly to each recipe file and clean up
afterwards.

In case of
.BR "config_only",
the recipes provided are processed up to the point where all the machines
are prepared and properly configured. No tests will be executed and the
cleanup phase is omitted as well. This mode of operation is useful if you
want to perform some specific actions or tests outside of LNST using
the configuration specified in a recipe file.

In case of
.BR "deconfigure",
the configuration from a previous config_only run will be removed, including
dynamically created devices on virtual machines. There is no need to specify a
recipe for this action.

At last, when the
.I ACTION
is set to
.BR "match_setup",
.B lnst-ctl
will only try to match the configuration in the recipe with its local
pools and print the resulting match, in case it was successful or an
appropriate error message, in case it was not.

.SH CONFIGURATION
.B lnst-ctl
will look for configuration in the following locations:

.I @conf_dir@lnst-ctl.conf
.br
.I ~/.lnst/lnst-ctl.conf

For further description of file format or configuration options available,
please refer to the configuration file itself, where each option is
documented.

.SH EXIT STATUS
.B lnst-ctl
will terminate with one of the following statuses:

    0    All tests passed, no errors encountered
    1    At least one test failed
    2    There was an error during the execution
