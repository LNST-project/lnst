    This only really makes sense for recipes that have asymmetric endpoints.

    For example:

        SimpleNetworkRecipe is symmetrical since both endpoints are of the same type (both plain interfaces).

        TeamRecipe is asymmetrical because one endpoint is a team device and the other is a plain interface.

    So TeamRecipe could use this mixin to indicate that the flow of traffic can be reversed.

    This can be controlled by the `perf_reverse` parameter:

    :param perf_reverse:
        Parameter used by the :any:`generate_flow_combinations` generator.
        To specify that the flow of traffic between the endpoints should be reversed.
    :type perf_reverse: :any:`BoolParam` (default False)
