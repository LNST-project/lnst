[IMPORTANT UPDATE ABOUT RECENT REPOSITORY CHANGES](https://lists.fedorahosted.org/archives/list/lnst-developers@lists.fedorahosted.org/thread/WK2PWZSUVDDJBQCJSZDR6WCJKZ44ZKVU/)

We recently went through some breaking changes to the repository code base as
outlined in the linked email. These have been coming for a long time as most of
our development was focused on the 'next' branch (now renamed to master).

A lot of the 'next' functionality is ready to be used for testing purposes but
we've yet to mark individual library APIs as 'stable' so no guarantees for
backwards compatibility are yet in place.

# LNST - Linux Network Stack Test #
